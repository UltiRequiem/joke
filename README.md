## How the Jokes were collected

The first 300 Jokes comes from
[15Dkatz/official_joke_api](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api), the
problem with that project is that its
[server is down](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api/issues/93), and it
[has not been updated for 2 years](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api/commits/master).

The other jokes were progressively added by the [contributors of the project](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/joke/graphs/contributors).

## Contributing

Submit a Pull Request, with your joke added to the [data.ts](./data.ts) file.
Make sure the joke is in this format:

```typescript
{
  "id": last joke id + 1,
  "type": "programming",
  "setup": "What's the best thing about a Boolean?",
  "punchline": "Even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit."
}
```
